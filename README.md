# ðŸŽ“ Graduation Research Project  
### Separation of Variables and Exact Solutions to Nonlinear PDEs  
Faculty of Science â€“ Alexandria University  
Supervised by: Dr. Farid Hamza

## ðŸ“˜ Overview  
This project explores analytical techniques for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on the method of **generalized separation of variables**. It targets equations of mathematical physics involving power-law nonlinearities, wave behavior, and complex boundary layers.

## ðŸ§  Motivation  
Nonlinear PDEs often arise in mathematical models across physics, biology, and engineering. Since general solutions are rarely obtainable, this research aims to construct **exact solutions** using structured separation methods, including the **splitting principle** and **functional differential equations**.

## ðŸ§ª Key Topics Covered  
- Multiplicative & additive separable solutions  
- Heat equations with nonlinear sources  
- Nonlinear wave models  
- Guderley equation and transonic gas flow  
- Polynomial and composite solutions  
- LaTeX-based report structure

## ðŸ“‚ Project Details  
- Prepared in **LaTeX** for precision and academic clarity  
- Includes multiple examples with step-by-step solutions  
- Based on references like Polyanin, Galaktionov, and Titov's methodologies
